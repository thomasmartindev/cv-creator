# CV Creator

React application that allows users to input their details into a CV template which is downloadable in PDF format.

The template contains information such as work experience, education, skills and more. The colour scheme of the template is customisable.

To avoid prop drilling, this project uses the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to share data across its components.
